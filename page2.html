<div class="blogtext">

    There are 5 ways I’d recommend you start your journey to a plant-based diet:
<br/>
   1. Why? 
    Be it health reasons or lent it’s important to have a reason why you want to have a plant-based, in order to help you stay committed.
<br/>

    2. Dairy
    Reducing the amounts of direct dairy you intake over time makes for a smoother transition to a plant-based diet. Direct dairies are milk based products such as yogurts, milkshakes, ice creams, cheese etc.
<br/>
    Once you’ve maintained this for however long you decide is necessary, do that same with indirect dairy which perhaps at little more challenging. Indirect dairies are products which contain milk as one of many ingredients (be careful and check all the labels, its not always obvious!). Most pre-packed food will specify if it’s vegan friendly.
<br/>
    3. Try before you buy?
    Try to incorporating more and more vegan food into your diet. Check out of SEEKING (link) page for our restaurant recommendations. Also, Tesco’s <span class="importantmsg"></span>Wicked range and M&S food <span class="importantmsg">Plant Kitchen</span> are my favourite places to grab my ready meals like pasta, enchiladas to pizza. Plant-based dips, Hippeas crisps and Graze treats are my favourite snacks during the day.
<br/>
    4. Meat substitues?
    There are more and more meat substitutes available at super markets, that taste exactly the same and are twice as healthy like Quorn mince or Chik’n nuggets. It’s all about personal preference. Why not buy a few and try following some recipes or bette yet Youtube videos.
<br/>
    5. Failing that, go cold-turkey or cold-seitan. </p>
